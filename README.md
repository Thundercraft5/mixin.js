## `mixin.js` 
`mixin.js` is a lightweight library written in TypeScript that allows you implement mixins. Has `0` dependencies and can be run on any platform.

## What does this do?
This library creates mixin classes via proxies, which are special classes which also index the mixin classes before deferring to the base class for resolution.
This library has full TS support *with generics* via declaration merging.

## Usage
**TODO**
